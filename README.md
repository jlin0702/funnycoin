A question that has been bothering me for a long time is "whose property is our speech?" 
Many people may not care, but the truth is that these words are collected by capitalists and become their assets. 
We express our opinions, insights and help others in need in the forum. 
But once the capitalists decide to remove it, there is nothing we can do to stop them. 
So an idea came to my mind, can we have a decentralized chat history? 
This idea has become more and more real under the blockchain technology.

Our program is divided into two parts, the first part is the kernel of the program, which applies blockchain technology to form a pattern. 
His block not only has the traditional ledger, the pre-hash, his own hash, but also the merkle hash. 
The difference is that there is an additional place to store information.
I intend to use this to achieve a goal that what we say on the forum will no longer belong to any body.
We provide a UI ourselves, but anyone who uses the appropriate method and creates a new UI can restore the original appearance of the forum. 
And people can use different UIs to participate in the same chat, which has never been done before.
